# SGInnovate × NRP — Tech Talk: “Beam There, Bot”

Notes and reflections from SGInnovate × National Robotics Programme, in collaboration with KABAM Robotics, SIMTech, and ARTC. The event gathered leaders across research and industry to discuss robotics, AI, and talent in Singapore’s deep tech ecosystem.

## Overview
Singapore is positioning itself not only as a technology adopter but as a creator of globally competitive robotics solutions. The event emphasized two pillars:
- Technical progress in robotics and AI (perception, control, RL, ROS/ROS2, Sim2Real).
- Talent pipelines and translational mechanisms that turn research into deployable systems.

## Keynotes
- Priscilla Looi — Deep learning + robotics direction in Singapore’s ecosystem; building capacity for high‑impact, applied robotics.
- Ai Peng New — Talent as a strategic lever; the need for stronger training, mentorship, and pathways from academia to industry.

## Workshops
- Workshop 1 (Dr Lin Wei & Dr Tan Jun Liang): Application‑oriented robotics opportunities; mapping research problems to commercialization and deployment.
- Workshop 2 (Mr Glenn Tan & Ms Sheila Suppiah): Hands‑on development with ROS (and ROS2), emphasizing modularity, scalable integration, and best practices.

Both workshops highlighted bridging foundational research (algorithms, control, perception) with real‑world deployment (interfaces, safety, maintainability).

## Panel — Empowering Talent
The highest‑priority segment focused on talent:
- Strengthening pipelines: internships, research residencies, and co‑supervised projects.
- Practical fluency: ROS/ROS2, perception stacks, RL/control, and robust engineering practices.
- Collaboration: academia ↔ institutes ↔ startups for repeatable, reproducible results.
- Open‑source contribution as a credibility signal and accelerant for the ecosystem.

## Technical themes I’m tracking
- Multimodal perception: depth + vision + language for intent and feedback.
- RL and planning: growing emphasis on model‑based/world‑model approaches to improve sample efficiency.
- Sim2Real: domain randomization, calibration, evaluation loops, and documentation to make results transferable.
- Systems engineering: data pipelines, safety checks, and benchmarking to move beyond demos.

## My next steps
- Build an embodied RL agent with visual servoing in Isaac Gym/MuJoCo; add depth fusion and evaluate transfer.
- Package a ROS2 demo that cleanly integrates perception → control → logging; open‑source the stack.
- Write a short “Singapore Robotics Ecosystem” note (players, labs, datasets, benchmarks) to contextualize projects.
- Seek co‑supervised opportunities linking chemistry + robotics for applied scientific automation.
