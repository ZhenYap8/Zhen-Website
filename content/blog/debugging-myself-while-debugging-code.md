# Debugging Myself While Debugging Code

I don’t usually write blogs like this, but today I just need to let it out. Building this website has been one of the most mentally and physically draining things I’ve done in a while. I knew coding could be frustrating, but no one really prepares you for the emotional marathon of chasing error after error until you’re running on fumes.

It started innocently enough. I sat down, motivated, with my coffee and a fresh to-do list. “Just fix a couple of bugs,” I told myself. A few hours later, I was knee-deep in error messages that made absolutely no sense, Stack Overflow threads that half-answered my questions, and documentation that felt like it was written in riddles.

Every time I thought I’d cracked it, another problem surfaced. Fix one line, break five others. Update one dependency, watch your entire project collapse. It’s like coding has this cruel sense of humor—it keeps dangling progress in front of you, then yanking it away at the last second.

But the worst part isn’t even the bugs. It’s the exhaustion that creeps in. The tiredness isn’t just in my body—it’s in my brain. You start reading the same line of code 20 times, and it just looks like hieroglyphics. You forget why you even started the project. You question if you’re even cut out for this.

There’s a strange loneliness to debugging too. It’s just you, the errors, and your own patience. No applause when you fix something. No one sees the hours of staring blankly at the screen, the cycle of hope and despair every time you hit “run.”

And I’ll be honest: right now, I’m not at the “happy ending” part of the story. I’m not writing this after a breakthrough or a clean build. I’m writing this in the thick of it, exhausted and worn down, because that’s part of the coding journey too. The part no one glamorizes in tutorials or success stories.

Maybe tomorrow I’ll wake up, open my laptop, and things will click. Or maybe I’ll dive right back into the pit of error logs and frustration. Either way, I know this: the grind is painful, but it’s also what makes the breakthroughs matter.

For now, though? I’m just tired.
